# Quick Fix Summary - WebSocket Disconnection Issue

## 🔧 Problem
GUI shows "disconnected" and reconnects instantly (flickering status)

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Changes to `frontend/src/App.jsx`:

1. **Reduced ping frequency:** 4s → 15s
   - Less network overhead
   - More standard heartbeat interval

2. **Added pong timeout detection:** 30 seconds
   - Tracks when last pong received
   - Only disconnects if server truly unresponsive

3. **Faster reconnection:** 5s → 2s
   - Quicker recovery from temporary issues

4. **Better cleanup:** Added pong timeout cleanup
   - Prevents memory leaks
   - Cleaner connection management

## 🚀 To Test

**Restart frontend:**
```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Expected behavior:**
- ✅ Status stays "CONNECTED" without flickering
- ✅ Tolerates network hiccups up to 30 seconds
- ✅ Reconnects within 2-3 seconds if disconnected

## 📊 Connection Timeline

```
Normal Operation:
0s ────── 15s ────── 30s ────── 45s
   ping→pong   ping→pong   ping→pong
   (CONNECTED) (CONNECTED) (CONNECTED)

Temporary Hiccup (<30s):
0s ───── 15s ───── 20s ───── 25s
   ping→   (delayed)   ←pong
   (CONNECTED - stays connected)

True Disconnection:
0s ───── 15s ───── 30s ─── 32s ─── 34s
   ping→   (no pong)    DISC   wait  CONN
                      (detect) (2s)  (back)
```

## ⚙️ Key Parameters

- **Ping Interval:** 15 seconds
- **Pong Timeout:** 30 seconds  
- **Reconnect Delay:** 2 seconds

All tunable in App.jsx if needed.

## ✅ Files Modified
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Improved WebSocket connection handling

Connection should now be **stable and rock solid**! 🎉

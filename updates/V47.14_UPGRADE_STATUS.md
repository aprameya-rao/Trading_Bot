    'rsi_period': 9,           # V47.14: Reduced from 14
    'rsi_signal_period': 3,    # V47.14: Reduced from 9  
    'rsi_angle_threshold': 12.5, # V47.14: Reduced from 30.0
    'min_atr_value': 2.5,      # V47.14: Reduced from 4.0
    'supertrend_period': 5,    # V47.14: Reduced from 10
    'supertrend_multiplier': 0.7, # V47.14: Reduced from 2.5
    'entry_proximity_percent': 1.5, # V47.14: Entry validation
    'breakeven_trigger_pct': 15.0,  # V47.14: Breakeven logic
}
```

### ðŸŽµ **Sound System**

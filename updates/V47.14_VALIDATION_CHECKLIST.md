## üß™ Functional Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Crossover Tracker
**Start bot and wait for Supertrend flip**
- [ ] Bot logs "üéØ Tracking BULLISH_CE_XXXXXX for 5 minutes"
- [ ] Signal appears in active_signals list
- [ ] Bot monitors signal for up to 300 seconds
- [ ] Trade executes when momentum aligns
- [ ] Signal removed from list after execution
- [ ] Alternative side (PE) also tracked
- [ ] Signals expire after 5 minutes if not triggered

### Test 2: Persistent Trend Tracker
**Start bot during established trend**
- [ ] Bot logs "üìà Created TREND_CONT_CE_XXXXXX"
- [ ] Signal created when price extends beyond highs
- [ ] Signal tracked for 180 seconds
- [ ] Trade executes on trend continuation
- [ ] Works for both CE (bullish) and PE (bearish)
- [ ] Multiple continuation signals can coexist
- [ ] Signals expire after 3 minutes

### Test 3: Red Candle Exit
**Enter a trade and wait for option candle to turn red**
- [ ] Bot checks option candle on every tick
- [ ] Logs "üî¥ RED CANDLE DETECTED" when LTP < Open
- [ ] Position exits immediately (no delay)
- [ ] Exit reason shows "Red Candle Exit"
- [ ] Works for both CE and PE positions
- [ ] Takes priority over other exit logic
- [ ] Does not trigger false positives

### Test 4: Multiple Partial Exits
**Enter trade that goes into profit**
- [ ] First partial at 20% profit (if partial_profit_pct = 20)
- [ ] Logs "Partial exit #1 complete"
- [ ] next_partial_profit_level increments to 2
- [ ] Second partial at 40% profit
- [ ] Logs "Partial exit #2 complete"
- [ ] Can continue for multiple levels
- [ ] Final exit when qty < lot_size
- [ ] All partials logged to database

### Test 5: Order Chasing (Paper Trading)
**Take any trade**
- [ ] Bot logs "üéØ Attempting to BUY with order chasing"
- [ ] Fetches market depth successfully
- [ ] Would place limit order at best ask (logged)
- [ ] Simulates retry logic
- [ ] Shows what market order would be used
- [ ] Position verification simulated
- [ ] No actual orders placed (paper mode)

### Test 6: Order Chasing (Live Trading - Use 1 Lot)
**Take any trade in live mode**
- [ ] Bot fetches real market depth
- [ ] Places limit order at best ask/bid
- [ ] Order ID logged
- [ ] Waits 200ms for fill
- [ ] Retries up to 3 times if not filled
- [ ] Falls back to market order if needed
- [ ] Verifies final position matches
- [ ] No cleanup messages (successful fill)
- [ ] Average price better than market

### Test 7: Lenient Reversal Validation
**Watch for reversal trade signals**
- [ ] Bot logs "üîÑ REVERSAL MODE: Bypassing..."
- [ ] Reversal trades skip strict breakout filter
- [ ] Continuation trades still use strict filter
- [ ] More reversal trades enter than before
- [ ] ATM confirmation still required
- [ ] Basic momentum checks still apply

### Test 8: Integration & Continuous Monitoring
**Let bot run for 1 hour**
- [ ] Trackers monitored on every tick (when no position)
- [ ] New crossover signals created on new candles
- [ ] Multiple signals can be active simultaneously
- [ ] Signals expire properly
- [ ] No memory leaks (check signal list size)
- [ ] CPU usage reasonable (< 30%)
- [ ] No duplicate trades
- [ ] Logs not excessive (< 100 lines/minute)

## üìä Performance Validation

### After First 1-Hour Session:
```
Expected Metrics:
‚îú‚îÄ Trade Count: 3-6 trades (vs 1-2 before)
‚îú‚îÄ Crossover Tracker Signals: 2-4 created
‚îú‚îÄ Trend Tracker Signals: 1-3 created
‚îú‚îÄ Red Candle Exits: 0-2 instances
‚îú‚îÄ Partial Exits: 1-2 instances
‚îî‚îÄ Order Chase Success: 100% (paper) or 80%+ (live)
```

### After First Full Day Session:
```
Expected Metrics:
‚îú‚îÄ Trade Count: 15-30 trades (vs 5-10 before)
‚îú‚îÄ Win Rate: 45-50% (vs 55-60% before)
‚îú‚îÄ Avg Winner: +35-45 pts (vs +50 before)
‚îú‚îÄ Avg Loser: -15-25 pts (vs -30 before)
‚îú‚îÄ Daily P&L: Better overall (due to volume)
‚îî‚îÄ Max Drawdown: Lower (due to red candle exits)
```

## üö® Red Flags to Watch For

### Critical Issues (Stop Bot Immediately):
- [ ] ‚ùå "CRITICAL: Cleanup order FAILED" messages
- [ ] ‚ùå Position mismatch at broker vs internal state
- [ ] ‚ùå Memory usage > 2GB
- [ ] ‚ùå CPU usage > 80% sustained
- [ ] ‚ùå 50+ trades in 1 hour
- [ ] ‚ùå Multiple failures in order chasing

### Warning Issues (Monitor Closely):
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Tracker signals not expiring (check time)
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Order chase fallback to market > 50%
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Red candle exits > 50% of total exits
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Win rate < 40%
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Active signals list > 20 items
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Logs showing same signal ID multiple times

### Normal Behaviors (Expected):
- [ ] ‚úÖ More trades than before (2-3x)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Lower win rate (5-10% drop)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Tracker signals created and expired
- [ ] ‚úÖ Some order chase fallbacks to market
- [ ] ‚úÖ Red candle exits protecting profits
- [ ] ‚úÖ Multiple partial exits per trade

## üîß Configuration Fine-Tuning

### If Too Aggressive (Too Many Trades):
```python
# entry_strategies.py
self.signal_timeout = 180  # Reduce from 300
self.continuation_window = 120  # Reduce from 180

# strategy_params.json
"max_trades_per_minute": 1  # Reduce from 2
```

### If Not Aggressive Enough (Too Few Trades):
```python
# entry_strategies.py
self.signal_timeout = 360  # Increase from 300
self.continuation_window = 240  # Increase from 180

# strategy_params.json
"max_trades_per_minute": 3  # Increase from 2
```

### If Order Chasing Failing:
```python
# order_manager.py
chase_retries=5  # Increase from 3
chase_timeout_ms=300  # Increase from 200
```

### If Red Candle Too Aggressive:
```python
# strategy.py in evaluate_exit_logic()
profit_pct = ((ltp - p["entry_price"]) / p["entry_price"]) * 100
if candle_open and ltp < candle_open and profit_pct < 5:
    # Only exit if profit < 5%
    await self.exit_position("Red Candle Exit")
```
